# Soft_Fascination

## Overview 
This project is based on the idea of soft fascination. Soft fascination is an effortless control of attention and can help reduce mental bandwidth/mental fatigue. For example, when we walk through the woods, we feel at peace and can think deeply because there is nothing that is forcefully grabbing our attention. This peacefulness allows our mind to rest, which reduces our mental stress. I wanted to play with this idea and create art that promotes soft fascination through the use of color noises. In the creator environment, users create bubbles that mimics our thoughts. When we move and think, we create new thoughts, while the older thoughts disappear because we have limited mental capacity -- humans can only hold 5+-2 thoughts at once. However, if the user is not moving the cursor, the bubbles will free roam without generating thoughts which represents our brain helping to recover our mental fatigue since we do not have anything forcefully grabbing our attention. The users can change noises by left clicking, accelerate bubble movement with up arrow and decelerate bubble movement with down arrow. Users can play around with how the bubbles are connecting together and getting generated with the mouse. The users can move the mouse as fast as they can to create mesmerizing art. They can save the art by pressing "P" (pauses the screen) then screenshotting. Everyone has full control of what they want to do while experiencing relaxing background noise. 

**Here are the benefits of each noise:**

White Noise: concentration for working and studying
Green Noise: calming effects for relaxation
Pink Noise: better sleep
Black Noise: silence, total concentration
Brown Noise: relaxation, improved focus, better sleep

## Bugs
There should not be any bugs in my system. Due to Google's Autoplay policy (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#iframe-delegation), the first load will not autoplay the noise unless you have modified your autoplay settings. Otherwise, the noises should start playing after clicking past the first load. If you want to autoplay the sound on first load, please follow these instructions on chrome.
